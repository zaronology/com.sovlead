              Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from
              other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely

              controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a
              "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you

              (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at
              least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such

              to the other Party.

            </h4>
            <p className="mb-4">
              If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
              negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly
              excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by
              binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION,
              YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
              The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the
              Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
              Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s
              Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA
              Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the American
              Arbitration Association (AAA) website. Your arbitration fees and
              your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA
              Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer
              Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be
              excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The
              arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of
              documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a
              decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons
              unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow
              applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator
              fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable
              AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in
              Sarasota, Florida. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
              Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
              proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or
              enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than
              arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the
              state and federal courts located in Sarasota, Florida, and the
              Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of
              personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to
              venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.

              In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in

              the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be

              arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
              provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute

              Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent
              permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any
              other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any
              Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize
              class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority

              capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

              arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
              concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property
              rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from,
              allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized
              use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is
              found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will
              elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
              provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute
              shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the
              courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to
              submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

              entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure
              to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms
              shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These
              Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We
              may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at

              damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our
              reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of
              these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or
              unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed
              severable from these Legal Terms and does not affect the validity
              and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint

              between you and us as a result of these Legal Terms or use of the
